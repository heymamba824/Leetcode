337. House Robber III

The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called root.

Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that all houses in this place form a binary tree. It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

Given the root of the binary tree, return the maximum amount of money the thief can rob without alerting the police.



Input: root = [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]
Output: 7
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.

树形递归：记录两种不同的状态，取该节点或者不取该节点

有一个疑问：为什么打家劫舍的题目都是取而不是选择性取或者不取
