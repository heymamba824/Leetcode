279. Perfect Squares


Given an integer n, return the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to n.

A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. For example, 1, 4, 9, and 16 are perfect squares while 3 and 11 are not.

Input: n = 12
Output: 3
Explanation: 12 = 4 + 4 + 4.

完全背包问题，里面有一个细节避免超时
如果每次都计算取值的平方，将会导致超时，先使用 nums = [i**2 for i in range(1, n + 1) if i**2 <= n] 将数值计算出来
