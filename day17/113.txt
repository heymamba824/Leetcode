113. Path Sum II



Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return all root-to-leaf paths where the sum of the node values in the path equals targetSum. Each path should be returned as a list of the node values, not node references.

A root-to-leaf path is a path starting from the root and ending at any leaf node. A leaf is a node with no children.



使用迭代法的时候，需要记录path的路径
1.复制当前path路径并传入
2.使用新的path_left = path + [val]来记录
