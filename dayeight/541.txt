541. Reverse String II


Given a string s and an integer k, reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string.

If there are fewer than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and leave the other as original.



Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"

每次以2k为界限，只改变字符串2k范围里面的值，前面k进行颠倒，后面k-2k保持原样
所以递推公式是  s = s[:p] + s[p:p2][::-1] + s[p2:]
