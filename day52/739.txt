739. Daily Temperatures


Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]


Monotonic Stack:
1. 存放到栈里面的是索引： index 索引
2. 单调递增或者递减，根据值，如果stack存放的值比栈的元素要小，那么就是单调递增栈
if temperatures[i] <= temperatures[stack[-1]]:
                stack.append(i)
