222. Count Complete Tree Nodes


Given the root of a complete binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.

According to Wikipedia, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

Design an algorithm that runs in less than O(n) time complexity.




判断是否是平衡二叉树：
1. 左子树的深度等于右子树的深度
2.如果是，直接使用公式来计算
3.如果不是，分别计算左右两颗子树的节点数最后相加
