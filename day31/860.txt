860. Lemonade Change

At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $5. Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you and order one at a time (in the order specified by bills). Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a $5, $10, or $20 bill. You must provide the correct change to each customer so that the net transaction is that the customer pays $5.

Note that you do not have any change in hand at first.

Given an integer array bills where bills[i] is the bill the ith customer pays, return true if you can provide every customer with the correct change, or false otherwise.

Input: bills = [5,5,5,10,20]
Output: true



当输入是20的时候，需要考虑两种情况，一种是10块有没有，有的话优先10块
如果没有的话 使用五块
