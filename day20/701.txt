701. Insert into a Binary Search Tree



You are given the root node of a binary search tree (BST) and a value to insert into the tree. Return the root node of the BST after the insertion. It is guaranteed that the new value does not exist in the original BST.

Notice that there may exist multiple valid ways for the insertion, as long as the tree remains a BST after insertion. You can return any of them.

class Solution:
    def insertIntoBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], val: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if not root:
            return TreeNode(val)
        cur = root
        pre = None
        while cur:
            pre = cur 
            if cur.val > val:
                cur = cur.left
            elif cur.val < val:
                cur = cur.right
        if pre.val > val:
            pre.left = TreeNode(val)
        else:
            pre.right =TreeNode(val)
        return root


###将节点作为递归函数的返回值
