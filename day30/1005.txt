1005. Maximize Sum Of Array After K Negations


Given an integer array nums and an integer k, modify the array in the following way:

choose an index i and replace nums[i] with -nums[i].
You should apply this process exactly k times. You may choose the same index i multiple times.

Return the largest possible sum of the array after modifying it in this way.

Input: nums = [4,2,3], k = 1
Output: 5
