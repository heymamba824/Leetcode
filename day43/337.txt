337. House Robber III


The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called root.

Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that all houses in this place form a binary tree. It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

Given the root of the binary tree, return the maximum amount of money the thief can rob without alerting the police.



Input: root = [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]
Output: 7
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.

1. Dfs + memo:
很多细节需要考虑，使用后序遍历来计算每个节点的最大值
递归终止的条件，因为是选这个节点不选子节点或者不选这个节点 选子节点
所以终止条件一个是空节点，另一个就是节点没有子节点

2. dp：
返回一个tuple来记录状态，tuple中记录选节点的状态和不选节点的状态
